Codecademy Project Dasmotos Arts and Crafts


The motivation for this particular project was to keep learning and building upon the skill set I learned from the UCLA Full Stack Development boot camp. I need to keep my skills honed so I do not forget them. In that spirit, I enrolled in the Codecademy Full Stack Development Program. This project is the first of what I hope will be many projects used to help me flex my muscle memory and continue my learning and growth.

This is a great example of creating the skeleton of a functional website, to be styled later with more intricate CSS stylings. It is a primitive e-commerce site as was prevalent in the early 90s.

## Future Development

A refactoring of this site to match todays current standards sounds like a fun and interesting way to continue learning with this particular project!
